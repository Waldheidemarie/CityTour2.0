# CityTour2.0
City Tour  is an android app that provides description about the city.
It uses navigation drawer and fragments. It also uses Arrayadapter to display the list of items. 
In this project android concept such as sending intent from one fragment to another fragment, 
how to handle a click listener in fragment and how to use array adapter in fragment are used.
This project was a great learning experience for me.
